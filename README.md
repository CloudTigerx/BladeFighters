# Blade Fighters - Puzzle Fighting Game

A complex puzzle fighting game with real-time combat mechanics, currently undergoing architectural refactoring from monolithic to modular design.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Blade Fighters is a puzzle-based fighting game where players compete by solving puzzles to generate attacks against their opponents. The game features:

- **Real-time puzzle solving** with falling block mechanics
- **Attack system** that generates offensive moves based on puzzle performance
- **Multiple game modes** including test mode, story mode, and quickplay
- **Audio system** with music and sound effects
- **Menu system** with settings and customization options

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### Status: Monolithic (Under Refactoring)
The codebase is currently a monolithic structure with tight coupling between components:

- **game_client.py** (1632 lines) - Main game loop and coordination
- **puzzle_module.py** - Core puzzle engine
- **attack_system.py** - Attack generation and management
- **audio_system.py** - Audio playback and management
- **menu_system.py** - Menu interface and navigation
- **settings_system.py** - Game settings and configuration
- **puzzle_renderer.py** - Visual rendering of puzzle elements

### Known Issues (Resolved)
- ✅ Alpha value clamping (was 303, now clamped to 255)
- ✅ Screen shake attribute missing (fixed)
- ✅ Invalid color argument errors (resolved)

## 🚀 Refactoring Goals

### Target Architecture: Modular Design
Transform the monolithic codebase into a clean, modular architecture:

1. **Core Engine** - Extracted puzzle engine with clean interfaces
2. **Event System** - Decoupled communication between modules
3. **Plugin Architecture** - Swappable components (audio, rendering, etc.)
4. **Data Contracts** - Clear interfaces between modules
5. **Testing Infrastructure** - Comprehensive test coverage

### Refactoring Tools Created
- **dependency_analyzer.py** - Analyzes module dependencies and coupling
- **test_framework.py** - Comprehensive testing suite
- **session_manager.py** - Progress tracking and context management
- **REFACTORING_TRACKER.md** - Detailed progress tracking
