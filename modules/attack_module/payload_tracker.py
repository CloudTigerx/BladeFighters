Payload Tracker - Advanced Attack Queuing and Delivery System

This module handles sophisticated attack payload tracking, timing, and delivery.
It manages attack states, delivery delays, and transformation stages.

Key Features:
- Advanced attack queuing with priority
- Delivery timing and state management
- Attack transformation stages
- Column rotation and placement logic
- Attack conflict resolution
