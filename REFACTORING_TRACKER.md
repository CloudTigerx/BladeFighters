# Blade Fighters Refactoring Tracker
*Last Updated: [Current Session]*

## üéØ MAIN GOAL
Transform the monolithic Blade Fighters codebase into a modular, maintainable architecture while preserving all functionality.

## üìã CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

### Architecture Status
- **Current**: Monolithic (1632 lines in game_client.py alone)
- **Target**: Modular with clear separation of concerns
- **Progress**: 0% - Planning Phase

### Critical Dependencies Identified
1. **Attack System** - Tightly coupled to grid and game state
2. **Puzzle Engine** - Core game logic, moderately coupled
3. **Audio System** - Already partially modular
4. **Menu System** - Somewhat independent
5. **Settings System** - Somewhat independent

### Known Issues
- Alpha value clamping fixed (was 303, now clamped to 255)
- Screen shake attribute missing (fixed)
- Invalid color argument errors (resolved)

## üó∫Ô∏è REFACTORING ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis (Current)
- [x] Create architecture documentation
- [x] Identify core dependencies
- [x] Set up tracking system
- [ ] Create dependency graph
- [ ] Define module boundaries
- [ ] Set up testing framework

### Phase 2: Core Engine Extraction
- [ ] Extract puzzle engine core
- [ ] Create clean interfaces
- [ ] Implement event system
- [ ] Add dependency injection
- [ ] Create data contracts

### Phase 3: Module Separation
- [ ] Separate attack system
- [ ] Modularize rendering
- [ ] Extract audio system
- [ ] Separate menu system
- [ ] Extract settings system

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Reintegrate modules
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation

## üîß TECHNICAL DECISIONS LOG

### Decision 1: Memory Context Strategy
**Date**: [Current Session]
**Problem**: AI memory context limitations during complex refactoring
**Solution**: Comprehensive tracking document + incremental commits
**Status**: Implemented

### Decision 2: Alpha Value Clamping
**Date**: [Previous Session]
**Problem**: Invalid color argument due to alpha > 255
**Solution**: Clamp alpha values before drawing
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

### Decision 3: Screen Shake Attribute
**Date**: [Previous Session]
**Problem**: Missing screen_shake attribute in PuzzleRenderer
**Solution**: Initialize in constructor
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

## üìä PROGRESS METRICS

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: ~5000+ (estimated)
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: High (monolithic)
- **Coupling**: Tight (needs reduction)
- **Test Coverage**: Unknown (needs assessment)

### Module Readiness Assessment
| Module | Current State | Coupling Level | Extraction Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Puzzle Engine | Core Logic | High | 1 (Foundation) |
| Attack System | Game Logic | High | 2 (Critical) |
| Audio System | Independent | Low | 3 (Easy) |
| Menu System | Independent | Medium | 4 (Medium) |
| Settings System | Independent | Low | 5 (Easy) |

## üß™ TESTING STRATEGY

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual module functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Module interactions
3. **Regression Tests**: Ensure no functionality loss
4. **Performance Tests**: Maintain game performance

### Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up pytest framework
- [ ] Create test data fixtures
- [ ] Implement mock objects
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## üìö RESOURCES & REFERENCES

### Python Refactoring Resources
- [ ] "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" (Martin Fowler)
- [ ] Python Design Patterns
- [ ] Clean Architecture principles
- [ ] SOLID principles

### Game Development Patterns
- [ ] Entity-Component-System (ECS)
- [ ] Observer pattern for events
- [ ] Factory pattern for object creation
- [ ] Strategy pattern for AI behaviors

## üö® RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk
- **Breaking existing functionality** during extraction
- **Performance degradation** from added abstraction
- **Memory leaks** from improper cleanup

### Medium Risk
- **Increased complexity** from modularization
- **Debugging difficulty** with multiple modules
- **Integration issues** between modules

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental changes with testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Comprehensive logging
- Rollback plans
