# ðŸŽ¯ Attack System Final Fixes

## âœ… **All Issues Fixed**

### **1. Strikes Not Sending**
**Problem**: Strikes were being treated as garbage blocks instead of separate attacks.

**Fix**: 
- Implemented `place_strike_blocks()` method for proper strike placement
- Strikes now use separate placement logic from garbage blocks
- Strikes are marked with `is_strike: True` for longer transformation time

### **2. Garbage Blocks Stop When Columns Full**
**Problem**: Garbage blocks would stop placing when columns were full instead of finding vacant slots.

**Fix**:
- Added `placed_count` tracking to show actual blocks placed
- Blocks continue to next column in rotation when current column is full
- Proper error handling for completely full grids

### **3. Breakers Included in Output**
**Problem**: Breakers were contributing to garbage block count instead of being excluded.

**Fix**:
- Added breaker count subtraction: `garbage_count = max(0, garbage_count - breaker_count)`
- Breakers now properly excluded from attack output
- Pure breaker combos generate 0 attacks

### **4. Strike Transformation Timing**
**Problem**: Strikes and garbage blocks had same transformation time.

**Fix**:
- Strikes take **3 landings** to transform (vs 2 for garbage blocks)
- Added `is_strike` flag to track strike blocks
- Different transformation logic for strikes vs garbage

## ðŸŽ® **How It Works Now**

### **Mixed Combo Example (Your Request)**
```
Breaking: 2x2 cluster (4 blocks) + 2 individual blocks + 1 breaker
Output: 1 strike + 1 garbage block (2 individual - 1 breaker)
Result: 1 strike + 1 garbage block sent to opponent
```

### **Strike vs Garbage Differences**
- **Strikes**: Generated from clusters, take 3 turns to transform
- **Garbage**: Generated from individual blocks, take 2 turns to transform
- **Both**: Use same column rotation pattern (1â†’6â†’2â†’5â†’3â†’4)
- **Both**: Fill vacant slots when columns are full

### **Breaker Exclusion**
- **Breakers**: Completely excluded from attack output
- **Subtraction**: Each breaker reduces garbage count by 1
- **Minimum**: Garbage count can't go below 0

## ðŸ§ª **Test Results**

All scenarios working correctly:

- âœ… **Mixed combos** â†’ Generate both strikes AND garbage blocks
- âœ… **Breaker exclusion** â†’ Properly subtracted from garbage count
- âœ… **Pure breakers** â†’ Generate 0 attacks
- âœ… **Column filling** â†’ Blocks find vacant slots when columns full
- âœ… **Strike separation** â†’ Strikes and garbage handled separately

## ðŸš€ **Future Enhancements**

### **Visual Differences**
- **Current**: Strikes and garbage look the same (both use `_garbage` type)
- **Future**: Different images for strikes vs garbage blocks
- **Future**: Different images for different strike sizes

### **Strike Sizing**
- **Current**: All strikes are single blocks
- **Future**: Strikes can be larger (2x1, 3x1, etc.) based on cluster size
- **Future**: Different column width requirements for different strike sizes

## ðŸŽ¯ **Ready to Use**

The attack system now provides:

1. **Proper strike generation** from clusters
2. **Correct garbage generation** from individual blocks
3. **Breaker exclusion** from attack output
4. **Column filling** when slots are available
5. **Different transformation times** for strikes vs garbage
6. **Mixed combo support** generating both attack types

The system is **fully functional** and ready for gameplay testing!
