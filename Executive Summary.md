Executive Summary
Community Centered App Concept
Puppy Pitstop is a mobile app designed to help everyday dog owners locate pet-friendly roadside rest areas that offer water, treats, and waste bags. These pitstops are independently hosted by community members and verified through the app. The app supports uploads, ratings, and comments for each pitstop while encouraging community involvement through DIY pitstop building. Puppy Pitstop offers optional starter kits via a built-in store to maintain consistency and safety.
Technical Foundations and Core Features
Built with the Ionic framework, the app uses a single codebase on Android and iOS. AWS services like Lambda, Cognito, S3, and DynamoDB support backend operations such as form submissions, media storage, user logins, and real-time data access. Google Maps API displays nearby pitstops based on the user’s GPS location. Push notifications via Firebase and AWS Pinpoint help keep users informed.
Storefront and Philosophy
The app includes a built-in storefront where users can purchase optional starter kits, including signage, treat containers, and branded materials. Stripe handles secure checkout, aiming to make setting up a pitstop easier for those who want consistency. While volunteers create and maintain most pitstops using their materials, these kits offer a ready-made solution without shifting the app’s focus away from community trust. Puppy Pitstop emphasizes utility, participation, and shared goodwill over profit.
Target Audience & Purpose
Primary Users and Intentions
Puppy Pitstop is designed for two core user groups: dog owners on regular walks who may suddenly realize their pet needs water or a break, and local community members who want to support those owners by setting up pitstops. Contributors may be homeowners, volunteers, or anyone who enjoys helping dogs and their humans in small, meaningful ways.
Real World Use Case
	For example, a local dog owner on a routine afternoon walk may suddenly realize their dog is overheating. With the app, they can quickly locate the nearest pitstop offering shade, water, or treats. This real-time need highlights the app’s focus on immediate, everyday utility, not long-distance travel or casual browsing.
Purpose and Philosophy
The app's purpose is to create a helpful, safe community tool. While an optional storefront exists, its role is not to generate profit but to make secure, consistent setups easier for those who need them. Kit sales help cover the cost of quality materials, but users are equally encouraged to use free guides and build pit stops with their supplies.
Application Architecture & Design
Visual Design Tools
Early designs were created using web whiteboards to plan the app’s structure and user flow. These helped visualize key interactions, from map usage to pitstop uploads and moderation. Storyboard sketches outlined screen-by-screen actions for core features like the map and submission form, ensuring intuitive transitions. A user journey map supports onboarding and long-term use, helping eliminate confusion and streamline navigation.
Mobile Design Practices
Navigation follows a tab-based layout, allowing users to easily switch between the map, submission page, profile, and store. The interface is built with Ionic’s native style components and styled with a soft, inviting color palette. The user experience focuses on fast page loads, responsive input, and a low learning curve; ideal for dog owners who may be using the app with one hand mid-walk. Accessibility is also a priority, with large tap targets, strong color contrast, and readable fonts for outdoor visibility.
Technology Stack Overview
•	Frontend: Built with Ionic + Angular using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•	Backend: AWS Lambda for logic, API Gateway for routing, Cognito for user auth, DynamoDB for data storage, S3 for photo and image handling.
•	Integrations: Google Maps API for pitstop display, Firebase, and AWS Pinpoint for push notifications.
•	Admin Tools: Moderation dashboard with role-based access hosted via Amplify.
Admin Dashboard & Access Control
Admins use a simple internal panel to approve pitstop listings, review flagged content, and manage user submissions. AWS Cognito’s role-based access controls provide access levels, ensuring only verified users can moderate. Admins can view pitstop details, user-submitted photos, and reports directly within the dashboard, streamlining the review process.
Operational Strategy & Sustainability
Storefront Integration
The app includes an optional store where users can purchase starter kits with signage, sealed treat containers, and branded materials. Orders are processed securely through Stripe, tracked in DynamoDB, and supported by image storage in S3. Order flow is handled by Lambda functions, with fulfillment managed manually at first, and plans to automate using services like Shippo. While future versions may explore QR-code-enabled boxes, the current system relies on trust. The pitstop owner stocks treats, and users are expected to take only what they pay for. The goal is to meet dogs’ needs simply and honestly, without complicated payment systems or barriers to access.
Business Model & Ethics
	Puppy Pitstop is not built to generate profit in the traditional sense. While the app includes an optional store for pitstop kits, each kit is priced slightly above production cost. This small margin is not for revenue; it is reinvested directly into the app, its infrastructure, outreach efforts, and future tools that support dogs and those who care for them. Every dollar made goes back to the mission. Pit stops operate on trust: users take what they need and pay fairly, while pitstop owners take responsibility for keeping them stocked. The app’s core features, locating, uploading, and reviewing pitstops, remain completely free, ensuring access for anyone who wants to help dogs stay hydrated, happy, and safe.
Testing Strategy
TestFlight will be used for beta testing on iOS, allowing selected users to try pre-release versions of the app. Their feedback and crash reports will help identify early issues and shape improvements. Bug tracking will be handled through tools like GitHub Issues or Trello, with reports sorted by type and urgency to streamline development. Unit testing will cover critical functions such as pitstop submissions, user authentication, and comment posting to ensure they work reliably before public release.
Marketing Strategy
TikTok will serve as the app’s primary growth platform, using short videos to highlight cute dog moments at pitstops, time-lapse builds, and community-driven events. To build ongoing engagement, Instagram and Facebook will focus on visual updates, reposted user content, and pitstop stoplights. YouTube will provide long-form content such as tutorials, build guides, and interviews that help explain the app’s mission and tools in more depth. The goal is to create content that resonates emotionally, informs clearly, and spreads organically.
Future Adaptations
Future updates may expand pitstops to include verified business locations such as pet-friendly stores or public dog parks. A loyalty rewards system could encourage community participation by offering points for uploading new pitstops or reviewing existing ones, with rewards like discounts or digital badges, early access to store items, or enhanced user profiles highlighting contributions. These additions would reward active users while keeping the core app experience free and community-driven.
Conclusion
	Puppy Pitstop is a thoughtful, community-driven solution to a real-world need. By offering a simple, mobile-friendly way for users to locate and create dog-friendly roadside rest spots, the app empowers individuals to support animal well-being through small but meaningful actions. With a focus on trust, accessibility, and care, Puppy Pitstop improves the pet-owner experience, one stop at a time.
