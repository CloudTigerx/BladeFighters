# üéØ SIMPLE ATTACK SYSTEM DESIGN

## Core Philosophy
**Simple but Rewarding**: Easy to understand, hard to master, with clear rewards for skilled play.

## üóëÔ∏è SIMPLIFIED ATTACK MECHANICS

### Basic Attack Generation
- **Breaking blocks** = **Garbage blocks sent to opponent**
- **Simple formula**: `garbage_blocks = broken_blocks` (1:1 ratio, no chain multiplier)
- **Chain multiplier**: Only affects clusters, not regular blocks

### Attack Types (Only 2 Types)

#### 1. Garbage Blocks (Standard Attacks)
- **Trigger**: Any block breaking
- **Formula**: `broken_blocks` (exact 1:1 ratio)
- **Example**: 
  - 3 blocks broken in 1x combo = 3 garbage blocks
  - 3 blocks broken in 3x combo = 3 garbage blocks (no multiplier)
- **Placement**: Rotate through columns (1‚Üí6‚Üí2‚Üí5‚Üí3‚Üí4)
- **Transformation**: 3 stages over 3 turns

#### 2. Strike Attacks (Special Attacks)
- **Trigger**: Breaking a 2x2 or larger cluster of same color
- **Formula**: `(cluster_size √∑ 4) √ó chain_multiplier` (minimum 1 strike)
- **Example**:
  - 2x2 cluster (4 blocks) in 1x combo = 1 strike
  - 2x2 cluster (4 blocks) in 3x combo = 3 strikes
  - 3x3 cluster (9 blocks) in 2x combo = 4 strikes
- **Placement**: Same column rotation as garbage blocks
- **Transformation**: 4 stages over 4 turns (1 turn longer than garbage)

### Chain System (Simplified)
- **Chain window**: Only combos in the same turn count
- **Chain multiplier**: Only affects strikes, not garbage blocks
- **No complex cluster detection**: Just count blocks and clusters

## üéÆ GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Basic Combo
```
Player breaks 4 blocks in a single combo:
- Chain multiplier: 1x
- Garbage blocks sent: 4 blocks (1:1 ratio)
- Result: 4 garbage blocks appear on opponent's board
```

### Example 2: Chain Combo
```
Player breaks blocks in sequence:
- First combo: 3 blocks (1x) = 3 garbage blocks
- Second combo: 2 blocks (2x) = 2 garbage blocks  
- Third combo: 1 block (3x) = 1 garbage block
- Total: 6 garbage blocks sent
```

### Example 3: Cluster Strike
```
Player breaks a 2x2 cluster (4 blocks) in a 2x combo:
- Cluster size: 4 blocks
- Chain multiplier: 2x
- Strikes sent: (4 √∑ 4) √ó 2 = 2 strikes
- Result: 2 strikes appear on opponent's board
```

### Example 4: Mixed Attack
```
Player breaks 3 blocks + 2x2 cluster in 3x combo:
- Regular blocks: 3 garbage blocks (no multiplier)
- Cluster: (4 √∑ 4) √ó 3 = 3 strikes
- Result: 3 garbage blocks + 3 strikes
```

## üéØ REWARD SYSTEM

### Skill Rewards
1. **Chain Combos**: Each additional combo multiplies strike damage
2. **Cluster Breaking**: Breaking larger clusters creates more powerful strikes
3. **Timing**: Quick successive combos maximize chain multipliers for strikes
4. **Efficiency**: Breaking more blocks per combo increases base damage

### Visual Feedback
- **Combo counter**: Shows current chain multiplier
- **Attack preview**: Shows what attacks will be sent
- **Damage numbers**: Display attack strength
- **Particle effects**: Celebrate successful combos

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION

### Simple Data Structures
```python
class AttackData:
    def __init__(self, attack_type, count, chain_multiplier):
        self.attack_type = attack_type  # "garbage" or "strike"
        self.count = count
        self.chain_multiplier = chain_multiplier
        self.target_column = None  # Set by column rotator

class ComboData:
    def __init__(self, broken_blocks, clusters, chain_position):
        self.broken_blocks = broken_blocks
        self.clusters = clusters  # List of cluster sizes
        self.chain_position = chain_position  # 1, 2, 3, etc.
```

### Simple Calculation Functions
```python
def calculate_garbage_attack(broken_blocks, chain_multiplier):
    """Calculate garbage blocks to send (1:1 ratio, no multiplier)"""
    return broken_blocks

def calculate_strike_attack(cluster_size, chain_multiplier):
    """Calculate strikes to send (mirror + chain multiplier)"""
    if cluster_size < 4:
        return 0
    
    base_strikes = cluster_size // 4  # Mirror the cluster size
    total_strikes = base_strikes * chain_multiplier
    return max(1, total_strikes)

def detect_clusters(broken_blocks):
    """Simple cluster detection - just count connected blocks"""
    # Implementation: Group connected same-color blocks
    # Return list of cluster sizes (e.g., [4, 4, 6] for 2x2, 2x2, 2x3)
    pass
```

### Column Rotation
```python
class ColumnRotator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rotation = [0, 5, 1, 4, 2, 3]  # 0-based columns
        self.current_index = 0
    
    def get_next_column(self):
        column = self.rotation[self.current_index]
        self.current_index = (self.current_index + 1) % len(self.rotation)
        return column
```

## üé® VISUAL DESIGN

### Attack Indicators
- **Garbage blocks**: Grey blocks that transform to colored blocks
- **Strikes**: Special sword-like blocks that are visually distinct
- **Warning effects**: Brief flash before attacks land
- **Transformation**: Clear visual progression through stages

### Combo Display
- **Chain counter**: "3x COMBO!" with increasing size/color
- **Damage preview**: "Sending: 3 blocks + 2 strikes"
- **Particle effects**: Celebrate successful combos

## üéØ BALANCING

### Attack Scaling
- **Linear scaling**: Garbage blocks scale linearly with blocks broken
- **Strike scaling**: Clusters mirror their size + chain multiplier
- **Reasonable limits**: Cap chain multiplier at 8x or 10x
- **Balanced damage**: No overpowered attacks

### Defensive Options
- **Quick clearing**: Players can clear attacks before transformation
- **Strategic placement**: Attacks can be used to create new combos
- **Timing windows**: Players have time to react to incoming attacks

## üöÄ ADVANTAGES OF THIS SYSTEM

### For Players
- **Easy to understand**: Clear cause-and-effect
- **Predictable damage**: Can calculate damage before attacking
- **Balanced rewards**: Chain combos reward strikes, not garbage
- **Immediate feedback**: See results of actions instantly

### For Developers
- **Simple to implement**: Few edge cases
- **Easy to balance**: Predictable scaling
- **Easy to test**: Clear inputs and outputs
- **Easy to extend**: Can add new attack types later

### For Game Balance
- **Predictable**: Players can calculate damage
- **Fair**: No random or hidden mechanics
- **Rewarding**: Skill is directly rewarded
- **Engaging**: Creates exciting moments

## üéÆ INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING CODE

### Minimal Changes Required
1. **PuzzleEngine**: Add simple attack calculation
2. **TestMode**: Route attacks between players
3. **PuzzleRenderer**: Add attack effect rendering
4. **Audio**: Add attack sound effects

### Event System
```python
# Simple event emission
def on_blocks_broken(broken_blocks, clusters, chain_position):
    attacks = calculate_attacks(broken_blocks, clusters, chain_position)
    emit_event('attacks_generated', attacks)
```

## üéØ CONCLUSION

This simplified attack system:
- **Removes complexity** while maintaining depth
- **Rewards skill** with clear, predictable mechanics
- **Balances damage** with 1:1 garbage and mirror strikes
- **Easy to implement** and balance
- **Fun to play** with immediate feedback
- **Scalable** for future enhancements

The key insight is that **simple mechanics can create complex, engaging gameplay** when players understand the rules and can make meaningful decisions.
