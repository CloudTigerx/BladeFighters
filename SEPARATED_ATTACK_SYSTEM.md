# 🎯 Separated Attack System

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

You wanted to separate attack output so that:
- **Clusters** generate **strikes** (not garbage blocks)
- **Individual blocks** generate **garbage blocks**
- **Breakers** don't count towards attack output
- **Mixed combos** generate both strikes AND garbage blocks

## 🛠️ **New Attack Logic**

### **Block Categorization**
The system now categorizes broken blocks into three types:

1. **Cluster Blocks**: Connected blocks of 4+ same color
2. **Individual Blocks**: Non-cluster, non-breaker blocks
3. **Breaker Blocks**: Blocks with `_breaker` in their type

### **Attack Generation Rules**
```
Clusters → Strikes (not garbage blocks)
Individual blocks → Garbage blocks (1:1 ratio)
Breakers → No attack output (excluded)
Mixed combos → Both strikes AND garbage blocks
```

## 🎮 **Examples**

### **Pure Cluster (2x2)**
```
Breaking: 4 blocks in 2x2 cluster
Output: 1 strike + 0 garbage blocks
Result: 1 strike sent to opponent
```

### **Pure Individual Blocks**
```
Breaking: 3 individual blocks
Output: 0 strikes + 3 garbage blocks  
Result: 3 garbage blocks sent to opponent
```

### **Mixed Combo (Your Example)**
```
Breaking: 2x2 cluster (4 blocks) + 2 individual blocks + 1 breaker
Output: 1 strike + 2 garbage blocks (breaker excluded)
Result: 1 strike + 2 garbage blocks sent to opponent
```

### **Cluster with Breakers**
```
Breaking: 2x2 cluster (4 blocks) + 1 breaker
Output: 1 strike + 0 garbage blocks (breaker excluded)
Result: 1 strike sent to opponent
```

## 🧪 **Test Results**

All scenarios tested and working correctly:

- ✅ **Pure clusters** → Only strikes, no garbage blocks
- ✅ **Individual blocks** → Only garbage blocks, no strikes  
- ✅ **Mixed combos** → Both strikes AND garbage blocks
- ✅ **Breakers excluded** → No attack output from breakers
- ✅ **Chain multiplier** → Affects strikes, not garbage blocks

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

### **For Players**
- **Clear separation**: Clusters and individual blocks have distinct effects
- **Strategic depth**: Choose between cluster formation vs individual clearing
- **Fair mechanics**: Breakers don't contribute to attack output
- **Predictable results**: Know exactly what each block type generates

### **For Game Balance**
- **No confusion**: Clusters don't generate garbage blocks
- **Proper scaling**: Chain multiplier only affects strikes
- **Balanced damage**: Individual blocks provide consistent garbage output
- **Clean mechanics**: Simple and intuitive rules

## 🚀 **Technical Implementation**

### **Block Categorization Method**
```python
def _categorize_blocks(self, broken_blocks, clusters):
    # Find all blocks that are part of clusters
    cluster_blocks = set()
    individual_blocks = []
    breaker_blocks = []
    
    # Categorize each broken block
    for x, y, block_type in broken_blocks:
        if '_breaker' in block_type:
            breaker_blocks.append((x, y, block_type))
        elif pos in cluster_blocks:
            pass  # Clusters generate strikes, not garbage
        else:
            individual_blocks.append((x, y, block_type))
    
    return cluster_blocks, individual_blocks, breaker_blocks
```

### **Attack Generation**
```python
# STEP 1: Separate blocks into categories
cluster_blocks, individual_blocks, breaker_blocks = self._categorize_blocks(broken_blocks, clusters)

# STEP 2: Generate strikes from clusters
for cluster_size in clusters:
    strike_count = self.calculator.calculate_strike_attack(cluster_size, chain_multiplier)
    # Create strike attack...

# STEP 3: Generate garbage blocks from individual blocks
if individual_blocks:
    garbage_count = len(individual_blocks)  # 1:1 ratio
    # Create garbage attack...
```

## 🎯 **Ready to Use**

The separated attack system is **fully implemented** and **tested**! When you run the game:

1. **Break clusters** → Generate strikes (not garbage blocks)
2. **Break individual blocks** → Generate garbage blocks (1:1 ratio)
3. **Break breakers** → No attack output (excluded)
4. **Mixed combos** → Generate both strikes AND garbage blocks
5. **Chain multipliers** → Only affect strikes, not garbage blocks

The system now provides **clear separation** between different block types and **predictable attack output** for much better gameplay!
